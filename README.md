## From Black Box to Clarity: Simplifying Aviation Conversations

This project aims to develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system to simplify complex conversations between pilots and air traffic controllers (ATC). These communications, essential for flight operations and safety, are often recorded in flight data recorders, or "black boxes," and are rich in technical jargon that can be challenging for non-experts to understand. Using datasets like ATCOSIM and reference glossaries such as the Pilot-Controller Glossary, the project focuses on transforming these dialogues into more accessible language. By applying advanced NLP techniques, including jargon detection, context-aware language modeling, and text simplification, the system will enhance accessibility to flight safety data. This effort aims to bridge the gap between technical aviation terminology and general comprehension, benefiting safety analysts, airline personnel, and the public.

The research highlights the importance of transparency in flight operations and safety evaluations, contributing to the ongoing efforts in aviation safety and communication clarity. By simplifying pilot-ATC conversations, the proposed system supports the broader goal of improving public trust and regulatory compliance while fostering a culture of continuous safety improvement. The project employs a multi-phase pipeline, starting with data preprocessing and jargon replacement, followed by using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for deeper contextual understanding and sentence restructuring. This approach ensures that the simplified outputs remain accurate and contextually meaningful, promoting better understanding of operational events and decision-making processes within the aviation sector.
